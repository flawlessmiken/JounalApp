    <string name="dummy">As I mentioned earlier, the createCircularReveal() method only
        works on LOLLIPOP and newer Android version, so this function has a TargetApi for build version LOLLIPOP.
        This means this function will not be called when fired up in a pre-LOLLIPOP device.</string>
